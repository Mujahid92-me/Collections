Collections is an API/Framework
Arrays-To store multiple values
 1.The Size is fixed
 2.It can contain only one kind of data type(type casting issues)
 
 
 Wrapper classes":
 wrapper classes are those use to wrap primitive data types so that they behave like an object.
 Integer,Character,Boolean,Long,Float,Double.
 
 
 List list = new ArrayList() vs ArrayList list = new ArrayList()
 
List is an interface, ArrayList is a class which implements List interface.

By creating an referance of type List and assigning to it an object of a type ArrayList like this. A) List mylist = new ArrayList(); You can use only the methods that are availivle in List and overriden in ArrayList.

But when you are creating an Arraylist type object like this. B) ArrayList mylist = new ArrayList(); You can use all the methods availible in ArrayList.

So If your ArrayList has a native method which is not availible in the interface List you can't use them with the example A).



 collections:
 1.Size is infinite
 2.Can contain multiple type of data
 3.
